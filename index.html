        <h2>Our Mission</h2>
        <p>At AlNaser Renewables Co., we strive to provide energy independence to families and businesses in the occupied West Bank.</p>
        <p>In the West Bank, energy outages are common, and energy independence is none-existant. The energy grid is entirely dependant on the occupation, and having energy generators can prove quiet expensive. Gas prices, due to high taxes by the occupation are some of the highest in the world. </p>
        <p>This is where renewable energy comes in. No one can control the sun, and thus, with the tools we provide, we give energy independence to those who seek it. Our projects generate 270,000<abbr title="Mega Watt Hours">mWh</abbr> of clean energy to Palestinian families and institutions, generating savings of over 17,000,000 <abbr title="Israeli new Shekel">ILS</abbr>. All this while providing clean and sustainable energy.</p>

            <figcaption class="about-img-caption">Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet consectetur adipisicing elit.</figcaption>            
            <h3>Origins</h3>
            <p>Our company started with our founder in 2016, who as a broke college student, was going around solar energy installations that had trouble, either with inadequate wiring or inverter programming problems, and fixing those problems. All he had to put in was his effort and knowledge, and people who already spent 10's of thousands for faulty solar installations were happy to pay a couple more to him to fix their problems.</p> 
            <p>Thus, he made bank. And with the money he made then, he started this company. With the base capital available, we worked on directly buying Panels, inverters and accessories in bulk from their chinese factories, and becoming the biggest reseller in the West Bank. We brought along some people who hadn't even finished secondary education or were illiterate and taught them how to install and connect everything, whereas the software programming could be done remotely, thus reducing installation costs by a huge margin, and increasing profits. </p>
            <h3>Mission</h3>
          <p>In 2020, we began dealing with Israeli gangs who would steal EV's and dissassemble them, where we would buy the EV batteries off them and refurbish/remanufacture them into batteries for solar power storage. The average price for a LiFePO4 battery specifically made for solar energy storage is 1000ILS/<abbr title="Kili Watt Hours">kWh</abbr>. A small business requires a battery of at least 50kWh's.
          A refurbished battery costs a 10th of that, and lasts just as long. And you can jack up prices and poeple would be none-the-wiser. Anyways, it's good money,<strong> we love making money.</strong>
            </p>
            <h3>Vision</h3>
            <p>
                We aim for a world where everyone has their own little energy station
